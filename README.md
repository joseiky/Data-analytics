# Data-analytics

**Python codes for machine learning, statistics, bioinformatics, and epidemiology**

---

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and notebooks for analyzing large-scale datasets, with a focus on applications in:

* Machine learning
* Statistics
* Data cleaning and structuring
* Visualization
* Bioinformatics
* Infectious diseases and epidemiology

The goal is to provide a resource for researchers, data scientists, and students working in computational biology, genomics, molecular diagnostics, and related fields.

## Features

* **Machine Learning & Modeling:**
  Scripts for supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and explainability (including SHAP, feature importance, and more).

* **Bioinformatics:**
  Tools for processing sequencing data, variant analysis, resistance gene identification, and genomics analytics.

* **Statistics & Data Cleaning:**
  Utilities for data wrangling, normalization, deduplication, and advanced statistical analysis.

* **Epidemiological Analysis:**
  Code for cohort analysis, prevalence and incidence calculations, interaction and association testing, and public health surveillance analytics.

* **Visualization:**
  Publication-ready plots and multi-panel figures using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other libraries.

## Use Cases

* Infectious disease diagnostics and surveillance
* Antimicrobial resistance analytics
* Genomic and molecular biology data analysis
* Epidemiological modeling
* General-purpose data analytics in biomedical research

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joseiky/Data-analytics.git
   cd Data-analytics
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   Most scripts require `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `jupyter`.
   You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(A sample `requirements.txt` will be provided soon.)*

3. **Run scripts or notebooks:**

   * Navigate to the relevant folder
   * Open Jupyter notebooks or run `.py` files as needed
