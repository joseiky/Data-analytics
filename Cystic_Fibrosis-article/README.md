Lay Summary 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by changes in the CFTR gene. We analyzed 10,282 genetic tests for CFTR variants conducted at a U.S. diagnostic laboratory from 2014 to 2025. Only 3% carried a disease-causing variant and most of those had the well-known F508del change. Almost every variant-positive sample was automatically flagged “abnormal”, con-firming that the laboratory screen works well. We also trained a computer model that used basic information—patient age, specimen type, and a handful of key variants—to predict abnormal results. It was correct more than nine times out of ten.
The study shows that harmful CF variants are now rare in routine adult testing and that sim-ple machine-learning tools can safely speed up result review.
